        <p>There are some very important questions and facts about Web!</p>
        <ol>
          <li><cite>How can the Internet be explained?</cite> The Internet is a system of connected networks, using the TCP/IP - protocoll. The messages, devided into packets can go through different ways - there is no central regulation</li>
          <li><cite>What is the WWW?</cite> Important: WWW is no analogy for the Internet! It is only an application containing ressources (files, databases...) and links to other ressources</li>
          <li><cite>What is the Client - Server - Model?</cite> Division of labour between <b>Server</b> and <b>Client</b>:
          <ul><li><b>Server:</b> Has a static IP-Adress, is always online and answers to requests of Clients</li>
          <li><b>Client: </b> Can have a dynamic IP-Adress, doesn't have to be online all the time and communicates with a Server</li></ul></li>
          <li><cite>What is the OSI - Model? </cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model" target="_blank">The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.</a><a href="media/tcpip.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="media/tcpip.jpg" alt="the OSI TCP-IP" width="100" height="30"></a></li>
          <li><cite>How can an IP - adress be defined? </cite> An IP - adress is an Internet - adress of a computer, enabling unique identification. The ISP dynamically provides IP - adresses to clients.</li>
          <li><cite>What is <abbr title="Uniform Ressource Identifier">URI</abbr>?</cite>URIs identify ressources definitely. DNS converts a domain into its belonging IP - adress</li>
          <li><cite>What is the scheme?</cite> Identifies the type of the ressource and the used protocoll. For example : HTTP, FTP </li>
          <li><cite>What is the authority and what does it consist of?</cite>Instance, which administrates the names in a namespace. Consists of userinfo(username/username: password) and host(port: Nr)</li>
          <li><cite>What is <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocoll">HTTP</abbr> and which steps need to be done?</cite>It is an application log, defining, how communication between Client and Server works.
          <ol><li>connection establishment through TCP/IP</li><li>request of information by Client</li> <li>answer of the Server</li> <li>connection termination</li></ol></li>
