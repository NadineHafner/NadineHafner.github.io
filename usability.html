        <h1>On this Webpage, I will tell you about my progress in learning about Usability- basics, necessarily connected with <a href="index.html">Webtechnology- basics</a> and <a href="html.html">Html</a> </h1>
        <p>This is my first own Webpage, so please be kind, if not all Usability - Heuristics can be observed on it. Also, this page will contain only some Basics about Usability because in our course we have learned loads of stuff about Usability.</p>

      <div class="questions">
        <p>There are some very important questions about Usability!</p>
        <ol>
          <li> <cite>Why is Usability so important?</cite> In order to avoid a switchover to another company, frustrations with your Webpage need to be minimized:  <ul>
            <li>hidden functions that are never used</li>
            <li> the result of an action is not visible eg you click on a button and nothing happens</li>
            <li> important information is very hard to find</li>
            <li>the aim of your company is not clear</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li> <cite>What is a so - called "Norman Door"?</cite> An user has to guess about whether to push or pull a door, because there is no special signage how to use it. </li>
          <li> <cite>What are Affordances? </cite> relationship between the characteristics of an object and the abilities of a person, determining the usage of the object. There is a difference between: <ol>
            <li> <b>real Affordances: </b> actions which are really possible</li>
            <li> <b>perceived Affordances: </b> actions the user thinks of being possible</li>
          </ol> </li>
          <li><cite>What are mappings?</cite> Relationships between the regulation of an object and its results on the object eg the swich - on of the hot - plates</li>
          <li><cite>Name usability - attributes (Nielsen)!</cite> All are shown in picture:<a href="attributes.png" target="_blank"><img src="attributes.png" alt="Heuristics by Nielsen" width="300" height="100"></a>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Learnability: </b> new users can learn the system fast</li>
            <li><b>Efficiency: </b> experienced users reach better performance eg. shortcuts etc. </li>
            <li><b>Memorability: </b> occasional users dont have to learn from the beginning everytime they use the system</li>
            <li><b>Errors: </b> Errors are failed actions according to their aim. In ideal circumstances the error rate is very small and errors can be solved very fast</li>
            <li><b>Effectiveness: </b> Precision and completeness of the reached aims of an action</li>
            <li><b>Satisfaction: </b> Every user should feel satisfied when using the system</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><cite>Heuristic Feedback: What does it mean and why is it so important?</cite> If the aim of an action is perceived only one second later, the System seems to react immediately. If the reaction lasts longer, Feedback eg a progress bar should be given as a sign that the System is not interrupted</li>
          <li><cite>Heuristic Reversible Actions: Why is it important?</cite> When using a System, the user occasionally makes mistakes. For example, he might accidentally click on a button. There should be a possibility to undo mistakes easily</li>
          <li><cite>Heuristic Error Prevention: What does it mean?</cite> A well designed System is able to avoid some mistakes of users by providing information what to do to reach an action. For example, when registering and typing a invalid telephone number, there is a warning that this number does not exist</li>
          <li><cite>What is a Persona and why is it important in Heuristic Evaluation?</cite>A persona is a prototypical User of a Webpage. A Persona is defined with all his/her attributes, hopes and fears so that evaluators not only investigate frustrations of the general user but of a concrete fictive person </li>
        </ol>
